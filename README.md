# Using Databases

This project is a result of applying SQL in a Node.js web application. My Bulletin Board Application allows users to post their favorite quotes to a webpage and peruse what others have contributed as well. Moreover, it updates and stores the information received to my local database in PostgreSQL, my relational database system of choice.
